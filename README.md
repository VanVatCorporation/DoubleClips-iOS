## ⚙️ Install

iOS installation isn’t currently possible, so please wait. (I’m a bit short on cash for the $99.99 annual fee)

## 🧧 Happy Lunar New Year

Project development will be on hold until the 10th day of the Lunar New Year (February 26) in celebration of the holiday.  
Thank you for your understanding, and Happy New Year! 🍻


## 🚜 Current Features

- 5% of all Android features.
  
## ✅ Requirements

### 👨‍💻 Windows / MacOS / Linux

- We’re currently developing the Android and iOS versions, so they’re not available just yet.
   
### 📱 iOS

- Minimum iOS version: 15
- FFmpeg Support (You can check if your device supports it by opening the app).

And that’s about it! High-end devices render faster, low-end devices take longer, but the functionality stays the same!

## 🤝 Contributing

We’re excited for contributions! While we’re busy developing and refactoring certain parts, there are still plenty of great ways to help out. 

~~Check out our Contributing Guide for setup steps, dev guidelines, and full focus area details.~~

Quick start: 
 - Fork the repo, clone it locally.
 - ~~Follow CONTRIBUTING.md~~
 - Create a feature branch, and open a PR.

## 🚀 Roadmap


### 🎥 Actually using Rajawali to edit 3D scenes? 

Right now, the project includes Rajawali, but it isn’t fully functional across the app. The idea is to let you modify 3D scenes and edit them like any other Clip instance, with Rajawali’s JSON structure attached. Once implemented, DoubleClips should be able to use Rajawali alongside the traditional FFmpeg, potentially supporting 3D text and other features, making the app more powerful for video editing.

### 🤖 AI-generated content? 

If you’ve used CapCut, you might have noticed some templates now support it. Guess what? DoubleClips can do it too! However, running text generation AI takes a lot of resources, and our current machine can’t handle it on its own. So how would it manage a single prompt for a video? Without a powerful server, we need your help to tame this beast, upgrade the API, and more. Check out the *Donate* section below for details.

### 💼 iOS/MacOS/Windows/Linux Support?

Of course, we plan to expand beyond Android. Imagine not needing a mobile device to use the template system, unlike CapCut (correct me if I’m wrong). With DoubleClips, any device will have the same functionality, with the only difference being video rendering speed. You also won’t need a CapCut subscription for cloud storage to move projects from mobile to PC. Instead, you can simply export your project as a zip file, transfer it to your PC, and reimport it—switching between platforms with just a few clicks!

### 🎬 Version Control like Github? Team Chat, Realtime remote edit like Figma, Canva?

Imagine DoubleClips as a cross-platform video editor that integrates version control like GitHub, supports private team projects for organizations, includes built-in team chat, and offers real-time collaborative editing with visible cursors, just like Google Docs, Figma, or Canva. It could become a more advanced yet free video editing software, combining these powerful features to enhance teamwork and creativity.

### ✨ Split Application Distribution?

Right now, DoubleClips is being developed by just one person, but in the future, anyone will be able to contribute, so the project could be split into two versions. Similar to Visual Studio Professional and Visual Studio Community, we could have DoubleClips and DoubleClips Community. DoubleClips would be distributed through all major stores like Google Play Store (Android), App Store (MacOS/iOS), and Microsoft Store (Windows), while DoubleClips Community would be available via its own GitHub repository and our website, with .apk for Android, .exe for Windows, and .dmg for MacOS. DoubleClips could also adopt the Community version’s distribution methods. New features from DoubleClips Community could be added to DoubleClips if users vote in favor, and if more than 50% agree, the feature’s code would be reviewed by our supervisor for malware or harm before being released across all stores with proper attribution. For example, in the Google Play Store’s “New features” section:

**[New features]**
```
[Main]
New feature 1.
New feature 2.
[Community]
[some-nice-guy-in-github-1] Add some new feature.
[some-nice-guy-in-github-1] Optimize code.
[some-nice-guy-in-github-2] Fix Track.
```
Some stores may limit the length of new feature descriptions, so our website would display the full list in the same format.



## 💰 Donate

Most open-source projects are nearly non-profitable, which means we rely on your support to survive this harsh reality. Instead of asking for subscriptions — no, we don’t do that here — why not consider donating so the project can develop faster?
